    <td> What strategies were effective?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The strategy that was supposed to be effective, was reading the book, but we did not understand it. Near the end of the lesson we completed project 2, and saved our work on a memory stick.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We had to look in the instructions for project 2 lots of times so we did take a lot of time doing project 2. I need to stop skipping ahead to the work I want to do when there is other work to be done first.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will look at the instructions carefully so I don't miss anything out. I will improve by reading the instructions quickly, so I can get more work done in the time given.</td>
