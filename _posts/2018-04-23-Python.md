    <td>Firstly, I had to go on codecademy and start the course about how to code python. Whilst trying to do this, I saw that my account had a name. It was textMaster78528. I changed my account's name to PastaPotPal. In just two days, (one lesson and 30 minutes at home), I had managed to get to part 10 of stage 1.</td>
