    <td>Today, like last week and the week before, Ash was not here. I decided to go with Yusuf again and we continued from where we were last week. We got further than last time, but the wall that was supposed to be in the game wasn't there. We tried seeing what was incorrect, but we couldn’t find anything.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Trying to find why the wall wasn’t there took some time off the actual lesson ( even though we still can’t find it ) also it was summer timings so we finished early. I need to stop procrastinating as it wastes time.</td>

    <td>Next time I will just try and get on with the task and then find any problems. I will improve my learning by typing and reading the text at the same time.</td>
