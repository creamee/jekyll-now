    <td>At the start of the lesson I thought this would be a piece of cake. As time moved on, we found out that it would not be a piece of cake (probably a whole biscuit), but really hard.
I forgot my memory-stick today and I am still on the same project.</td>

    <td>We found using the bread-board and the LED lights and the mini wires very complicated so we are still where we were on that task. I need to stop procrastinating.</td>

    <td>Next time I will read the booklet very carefully so I know where to put the wires and LED lights. I will improve my learning by concentrating on the task.</td>
