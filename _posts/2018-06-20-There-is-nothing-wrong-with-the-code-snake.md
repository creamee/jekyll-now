    <td>Today I started up codecademy and tried to get past a level that I had been stuck on for most of my 30 minutes at home last week. After asking the teacher for help and clicking the solution button to find out that my code was actually right, I was completing levels at a steady rate. At the end of the lesson I had managed to complete 3 levels.</td>
