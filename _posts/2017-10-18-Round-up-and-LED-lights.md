    <td>This time, we took turns where one would read while the other types, and then we would swap over. Although I had a bad headache, we got project 5 done and then we were on to stage 4, project 1. When we got all the wires and LEDs that we needed, we looked at the pictures to help us. We didn't finish stage 4 project 1 because we didn’t have enough time to do it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>We were a bit slow at typing in the code for the Raspberry Pi so that limited my learning. I don’t really know what habits I could work on.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will read the text faster so my partner can type it in. I will improve my learning by listening more to what my partner says.</td>
