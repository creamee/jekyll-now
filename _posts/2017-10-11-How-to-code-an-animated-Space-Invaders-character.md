    <td>This time we had to type the code in fast because if not we would of wasted lots of time. We decided that I would read and he would type. When he made errors, I always spotted them, then I would tell him them and he would correct them. In the middle of the lesson our teacher told us to send a link to our blogs. My partner and I did this instantly and we carried on with our work. In the end we had a colour changing Space Invaders character and half an hour left of the lesson. I also brang in a memory stick.</td>

    <td>We were blasting ahead in that lesson, so nothing really did limit my learning. I don't really need to work on any habits right now, so I canâ€™t really say anything in this section.</td>
