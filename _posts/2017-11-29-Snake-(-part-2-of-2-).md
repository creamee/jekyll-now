    <td>Today, Ash was not here, so I had to work by myself or with someone else. I went in a three with Jedd and Yusuf, so I had some people to work with. I had brought in my memory stick and the instructions for snake ( I printed them out ) and we almost got to page 3.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the start I couldn't start my Raspberry Pi up as the computer I used didn't seem to work. I chose a different computer and it still didn't work, so I changed the Raspberry Pi fuzebox with a different one and then it worked. That was what limited my learning. I need to stop procrastinating.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will check whether or not the fuzebox I pick works. I will improve my learning by concentrating hard on the work I am doing.</td>
