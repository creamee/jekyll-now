    <td>Today our teacher had to go somewhere, so we had a cover, I also realised that my partner wasn't in school. I brought in two memory sticks today so I could save my work without the pain of having to start over. I got some help from Tobi, and that got me part-way through page 2 of 7 (page 7 is just a glossary of commands).</td>

    <td>My learning was limited by trying to find the equipment as the mouse was had to find. I need to stop procrastinating as it wastes time.</td>
