    <td>Firstly, I went to the Green room for what I thought was going to be drama. Then we found out that we were 8C, not 8B, and had to go to IT1. When we got to IT1 we were told to delete our repository on github, and I thought Mr. Keen was telling us to delete our accounts, and that made me sad. But then I realised it was just the repository, not the account. I am finding it quite hard to remember how to do the boxes and the background colour of my new blog, so I'm still working on that.</td>
