    <td>Today I thought that this lesson was going to be the same as last time, which for me was carrying on with Snake on Raspberry Pi. However, Mr Keen told us to edit our blogs. He said that he would like us to make it Christmas themed. He shown us things that we could do with our blogs, a website that could help us with our blogs called JS Bin and a teachers blog called 'angry technician' ( here is a link: https://angrytechnician.wordpress.com ). I am still editing my blog.</td>

    <td>I was trying things on JS Bin to help with my blog, which did take some time off the lesson, so that limited my learning. I need to stop giving up too quickly.</td>
