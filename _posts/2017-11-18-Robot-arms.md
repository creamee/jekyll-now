    <td>This time I had a new partner (and I forgot my memory stick, again). Even though I had not completed the LED lights task, I moved on to the next one, which happened to be controlling a robot arm by using a Raspberry Pi. It was easy at first, but we just ran out of time.</td>

    <td>At the start we needed to get our equipment, one piece of equipment was a robot arm, and this took some time of our lesson because many were out of charge. I need to stop procrastinating.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will get all the equipment that we need and check that they are not broken or out of charge. I will improve my learning by reading the instructions carefully.</td>
