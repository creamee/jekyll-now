    <td>When I came into the lesson I found out that the site had blocked everyone who wasn't on it already. I decided that I would do some coding at home to make up for the time that I had lost in the lesson.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I only had 30 minutes of the lesson (I was in AD1 for the first half of the lesson). When I got into the classroom I found out that the website had blocked everyone. Some people were still on codecademy because the website didnâ€™t block the people who were on it at the start of the lesson. I decided to do some more coding at home because of this. I need to stop getting distracted.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will set codecademy up immediately and start coding. I will improve my learning by reading the instructions (if any).</td>
