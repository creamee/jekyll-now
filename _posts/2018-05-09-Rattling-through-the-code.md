    <td>What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At the start of the lesson, we all had to put where we were at on codecademy onto the google sheet. Because I had already done this before the lesson, I could start coding straight away.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The person next to me was trying to hack into codecademy by doing Ctrl + I. I looked at his computer many times because of that. I need to stop procrastinating.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to not be distracted by what someone else is doing on their computer. I will improve my learning by paying more attention to the detail of what needs to be done.</td>
