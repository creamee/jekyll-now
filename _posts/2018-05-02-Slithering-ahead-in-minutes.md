    <td>At the start of the lesson, I started up codecademy and started coding. Then, the teacher shown us the code for the google classroom. He then shared a google sheet with us. When I had finished doing my part on it, I went back onto codecademy to continue coding python.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Our teacher made a google sheet for all of us to put where we were on the python course on codecademy. While people were putting their names down on the sheet (google sheet not paper sheet), someone, replaced many names with my name, making me have to tell some people that it wasn't me replacing their names with my name on the google sheet. I need to concentrate more.</td>

    <td>Next time I will go straight onto codecademy and start coding. I will improve my learning by daring to make mistakes and taking some risks.</td>
