    <td>In today's lesson, I started up codecademy and went to where I was up to. I ended up on a level which I found really hard. After asking the teacher for help, I decided to click solution. When I clicked solution, I found out that my code was correct, only that codecademy said it wasnâ€™t. During that lesson and 30 minutes at home, I had managed to complete 2 levels.</td>
