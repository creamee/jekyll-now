    <td>Well, we were told to read the lesson booklet, which we did and start coding it to say random sentences like: YAM for life (OR) I am stupid (OR) mikkel has weird hair (OR in yellow background and yellow writing) yellow.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

    <td>Actually, nothing really did as we were working in a group (of three called YAM). I don't think there are many habits that I need to work on while doing Raspberry Pi.</td>
